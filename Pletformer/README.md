# Pletformer

Welcome to Pletformer! No, it is not a typo, that is actually the name of this game.
This game was created with the help of Tech With Tim, using this video: [Python Platformer Tutorial | Animations, Sprites, Colillisions, Jumping, Gravity...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6DrRN5z_uU). He helped me create this platformer in python, which was one of my first.

## Thanks Tim!
